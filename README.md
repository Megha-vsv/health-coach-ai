Personal Health Coach AI

Personal Health Coach AI is an AI-powered health monitoring and recommendation system designed to help users improve their overall wellness. The application analyzes health data from wearable devices and provides personalized guidance for nutrition, exercise, sleep, and goal management.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of AI agents to build a smart and adaptive health assistant. It processes daily and long-term health data, identifies patterns, detects anomalies, and delivers actionable recommendations to users.

Project Level: Intermediate
Estimated Duration: 1 Week

## Core Features

* Health data monitoring using wearable devices
* Personalized nutrition recommendations and meal planning
* Customized workout and exercise planning
* Sleep quality analysis and improvement suggestions
* Goal setting and progress tracking
* Anomaly detection in health metrics
* Doctor visit preparation with summarized health reports

## AI Agent Architecture

The system is built using multiple specialized AI agents:

* Health Monitoring Agent: Collects and processes data such as steps, heart rate, calories, and activity levels
* Nutrition Tracking Agent: Tracks meals, calories, and nutritional balance
* Exercise Planning Agent: Generates personalized workout routines based on user fitness level
* Sleep Analysis Agent: Evaluates sleep duration and quality
* Goal Setting Agent: Helps users set and track health goals

## Wearable API Integration

The application supports integration with popular wearable platforms:

* Fitbit API
* Apple Health API

Collected data includes activity metrics, heart rate, calories burned, and sleep information.

## ScaleDown Data Compression

ScaleDown is used to efficiently manage long-term health data while maintaining full health context.

Benefits include:

* Compression of 12 months of health data by approximately 80 percent
* Reduced application latency by around 65 percent
* Faster health analysis and personalized recommendations

## Deliverables

* Health monitoring application
* AI coach interface
* User progress dashboard
* Health improvement analysis report

## Suggested Tech Stack

* Frontend: React or Flutter
* Backend: Python (FastAPI or Flask)
* AI and Agents: OpenAI API, LangChain, or similar frameworks
* Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
* Data Visualization: Chart.js or Recharts

## Expected Outcomes

* Improved user awareness of health habits
* Data-driven lifestyle recommendations
* Efficient handling of long-term health data
* Personalized coaching experience

## Future Enhancements
